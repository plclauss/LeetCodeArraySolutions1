# Zero To Mastery:
## Section 6: Arrays

---

There were 6 problems in total this section. (The 6th was bonus, and not on LeetCode).
<br><br>
The solutions to the first five are attached within the `solutions.cpp` file. They are called and tested through `main.cpp`; however, the `rand()` function I utilized could use some debugging. The numbers are often large and so random that there isn't a solution.
<br>
Regardless, they all passed on LeetCode, so feel free to test with values/test cases that you know well.
